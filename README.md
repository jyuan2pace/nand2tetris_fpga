# nand2tetris on an FPGA
This is intended to be nand2tetris (http://www.nand2tetris.org/) on an FPGA. 
It is for people who have already gone through the nand2tetris projects useing their hdl language & tools and want to try to get it working on an FPGA (De0-nano in my case).
Although this code is verilog you shouldn't be looking at it if you not done the course, it may count as cheating :)

I'm totally new to FPGAs so it could take a while for there to be anything meaning full here...
